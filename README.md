### If the app goes to production:
1. I will approach unit testing and integration testing
2. To ensure a smooth user experience as 1000â€™s of users, I have to pay attention to Load Testing and Scalability Planning, Caching, CDN, Database Optimization, Error Handling and Monitoring, Optimise Frontend
